# Background (more fancy title needed)

## Modelling in ecology
	
### A quick history
	
### Specificities of ecology
	
Variability + time*space + local interactions + observations through both experiments and field studies + open systems
Formalisation,simplifications often used in ecology, assumptions, …

### Ecological data, uncertainties, sampling
	
At different organisational scales: individual, population, community, ecosystem and all meta-

### Mathematical modelling / computational approaches (lots to discuss here from Game of life type stuff/von Neumann to IBMs/ABMs note: Grimm is not universally representative ;-) ) ? 	

### Appendices: Primer on vectors and matrices (multidimensional data)

### Appendices: Primer on analysis, dérivées, Taylor series, minimum/maximum…   

### Appendices: Removing dimensions, dimensional analysis
